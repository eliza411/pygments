Todo
====

- allow multiple token types per regex (done, but awkwardly)
- allow "overlay" token types (e.g. Diff + X) 
  - highlight specials: nth line, a word etc.
  - dhtml: overlays toggleable by javascript

- unit tests

- docstrings?

- lexers:
    * HTML with special formatting
    * ocaml
    * nemerle
    * scheme/lisp
    * windows batch files
    * assembler
    * objective c
    * bash
    * mysql/postgresql/sqlite
    * tcl
    * (la)tex
    * django templates 

- goto label HL support for languages that use it

- add a `Punctuation` token type for symbols that are not text
  but also not a symbol (blocks in ruby etc)

- add support for function name highlighting to c++ lexer

- styles should be able to define the overall background color

- tell the DelphiLexer how to differ between Operators and
  text.

- review perl lexer (numerous bugs)

- moin parser

- add folding? would require more language-aware parsers...
